= Backports Library

Essential backports that make it possible to use some of the really nice features of ruby 1.8.7, ruby 1.9 and rails from ruby 1.8.x

Conditions for inclusion:
1. Standard in either rails or ruby
2. Won't break older code
3. Simple and self-contained

The first and second rules avoids conflicts in future and the past respectively. Because of the second rule, incompatibilities between 1.8 and 1.9 methods are left alone.
For example, <tt>Module::instance_methods</tt> returns strings in 1.8 and symbols in 1.9; no change can be made without the risk of breaking existing code.

More complex features of activesupport (even things like <tt>String::pluralize</tt>), won't be included. <tt>require 'activesupport'</tt> if you need them!

I've added those as I need them; pull requests welcome (with tests for ruby 1.9 backports)

== Compatibility

Works with ruby 1.8 & 1.9

* Module
  * +alias_method_chain+
* Object
  * +tap+, +returning+
  * +try+
* String
  * <tt>start_with?</tt>, <tt>end_with?</tt>
  * +camelize+, +underscore+
  * +dasherize+, +demodulize+
  * +constantize+
* Hash
  * <tt>Hash[[[:foo, :bar],[:hello, "world"]]] ==> {:foo => :bar, :hello => "world"}</tt>
  * +key+
  * +symbolize_keys+, <tt>symbolize_keys!</tt>
  * +reverse_merge+, <tt>reverse_merge!</tt>
* Enumerable
  * +sum+
  * +find_index+
