= Backports Library

Essential backports that make it possible to use some of the really nice features of Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9 and rails from Ruby 1.8.x

Conditions for inclusion:
1. Standard in either Ruby or Rails
2. Won't break older code
3. Simple and self-contained

The first and second rules avoids conflicts in future and the past respectively. Because of the second rule, incompatibilities between 1.8 and 1.9 methods are left alone.
For example, <tt>Module::instance_methods</tt> returns strings in 1.8 and symbols in 1.9; no change can be made without the risk of breaking existing code.

More complex features of active-support (even things like <tt>String::pluralize</tt>), won't be included. <tt>require 'activesupport'</tt> if you need them and are not in rails!

I've added these backports as I need them; pull requests welcome (with tests for Ruby 1.9 backports)

== Installation & compatibility

+backports+ is mirrored on Rubyforge and can thus be installed with:

  sudo gem install backports

To use:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'backports'
  # and off you go!

Compatible with Ruby 1.8 & 1.9.

_note_: This usage of <tt>Hash::[]</tt> is not yet documented[http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1385].
